Kill all processes using an specific port just by specifying the port
# How to use it
```bash
./kports.ps1 <port1> <port2> <...>
```

You can also include this script in a folder included on the system's `$PATH` to be able to call this commmand everywhere like this

```bash
kports <port1> <port2> <...>
```
